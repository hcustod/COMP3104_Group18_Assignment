# DevOps in the SDLC Life Cycle

 Learning DevOps is essential in the software development life cycle (SDLC)
 because it bridges the gap between development and operations. 
 DevOps promotes automation, collaboration, and continuous delivery,
 ensuring that software is developed, tested, and deployed faster and
 more reliably. By integrating DevOps principles, teams can achieve higher
 efficiency, reduce errors, and improve overall product quality.
